<h1>NITC Automatic Number Plate Recognition with Raspberry Pi</h1>

Embedded System Project

</br>
<h3>Project Summary:</h3>
The project proposed is intended to automate the detection and recognition of license plates of vehicles, expand the collection of relevant data, and expedite the tedious and time consuming process of manually comparing vehicle license plates with lists of stolen, or authorizing and other vehicles of interest. The project suggests to keep an eye on parking spots or entrance gates with the help of cameras and raspberry pi, and alert officers to vehicles who are recognised by the system. 

<h3>Objectives of project:</h3>
Primarily we are focusing on Institutes especially NIT Calicut to provide a convenient and efficient way to monitor entered vehicles. ANPR systems function to automatically capture an image of the vehicle’s license plate, transform that image into alphanumeric characters using optical character recognition, compare the plate number acquired to databases of vehicles of interest to law enforcement and other agencies, and to alert the officer when a vehicle of interest has been observed. We understand that we cannot replace human strength and intelligence but technologies are bound to make our lives easy.

Our project will help in:
<ul>
<li>Authorizing selected vehicles for entrances.</li>
<li>Collecting relevant data regarding a particular vehicle(entry-exit time, driver’s name etc.).</li>
<li>Monitoring lost and stolen vehicles.</li>
</ul>
